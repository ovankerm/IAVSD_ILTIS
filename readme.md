# Benchmark Bombardier Iltis

This project is the simulation of the road Vehicle benchmark Bombardier Iltis. The full benchmark desciption is given in [1].

## Requirements
MBsysC must be installed, the current version is 1.22.0.

## Instructions
To build the project follow the followings steps for Linux or MacOS:
 1. Open a terminal in the _workR_ folder;
 2. Enter `mkdir build; cd build`
 3. Enter `cmake .. -DROBOTRAN_SOURCE_DIR="/path/to/mbsysc/MBsysC"`
    * The given folder must contains the folder _mbs_common_
 4. Enter `make`

Then run the simulation:
 5. Enter `./exe_Jeep`
 
Analyzing the results in the _resultsR_ sufolder:
 1. Equilibrium results:
   * The file _2_Equilibrium_Report.txt_ contains the values requested by the benchmark.
 2. The modal analysis results:
   * The file _modal_result.res_ contains all the identified modes
   * The modes are identified in the folder _../animationR_ as _mode_#.anim_
 3. Direct dynamic results:
   * Run the script _plot_graphs.py_ (generates updated figures).
   * The figure a saved in the _resultsR_ subfolder.
 4. Other: 
   * The file _1_Nominal_Report.txt_ contains some forces value in nominal configuration.
   * This allows to check the input dimensions as Robotran with the relative coordinates approach.

## Analysis
The model gives similar results for the following analysis:
